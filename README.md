# **BlackJack**

- Player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.
- For card values, the face cards are worth 10 and any other card is its pip value. The game automatically values the ace at 1 or 11 depending on the players hand.
- Before the deal begins, the player is able to place a bet with a limit of up to 100 chips. At the end game the player is notified of their total winnings at the end.
- Each game is its own instance so their chip winnings don't carry over to the next game.
